Execution:
1.	Change all file paths to a path that will execute on your computer
2.	Ensure numpy and psutil have been installed into your instillation of pip
3.	Execute python3 runner.py
4.	Execute python3 dataA.py
Notes:
1.	These scripts have only been executed using Windows Subsystem for Linux, WSL. Any other process for execution might require adjustments to file paths.
